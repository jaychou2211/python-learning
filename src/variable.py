# Think of a variable like a bucket that stores some data or stores some type.
hello = 'tim';
world = 'world';

# I know it's a variable because I saw it earlier on the program.
print(hello, world);

# You can make them equal to other variables.
world = hello;
print(hello, world);

hello = 'no';
print(hello, world);
